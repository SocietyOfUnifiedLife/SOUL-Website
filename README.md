### ## üìú What Is SOUL?

The **Society of Unified Life** (SOUL) is a grassroots, open-source system for organizing community action, humanitarian service, and ethical leadership‚Äîwithout hierarchy or coercion.

We help people form local chapters (Nodes), coordinate decentralized missions, and build a peaceful, transparent alternative to systems of control.

SOUL is not a revolution. It‚Äôs a quiet alignment.
