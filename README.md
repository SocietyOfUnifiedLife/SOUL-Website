# SOUL – Society of Unified Life  
*A quiet flame for a loud world.*

Welcome to the **official website repository** for the Society of Unified Life (SOUL)—a decentralized, nonviolent, open-source humanitarian framework.

This repo contains the static codebase and content for the SOUL public website:  
[SOUL Website](https://societyofunifiedlife.github.io/SOUL-Website/)

## What Is SOUL?

**SOUL** is a grassroots framework designed to help humanity collaborate across borders without coercion or hierarchy.

We offer:

- Tools for forming local chapters ("Nodes")
- Open-source strategy for peaceful cultural realignment
- Ethical leadership principles and decentralized missions
- Transparency-first practices with no central authority

We’re not here to seize power—we’re here to model something better.

> No ideology required. Just care, clarity, and cooperation.
