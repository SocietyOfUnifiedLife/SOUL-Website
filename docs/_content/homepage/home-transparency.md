## Radical Transparency, From the Start

##### We’re not official yet — no bank account, no paperwork, no funding. 

###### Just vision, values, and work in progress.

### But we’re building in the open.

#### From strategy to structure, every step will be public.  
#### Budgets, decisions, outcomes — all traceable, all accountable.

> ##### Transparency isn’t a feature.  
> ##### It’s the foundation.
