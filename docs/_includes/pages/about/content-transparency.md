##  Current Status (as of July 2025)

SOUL is an open-source experiment in decentralized humanitarian design.

- **Funding**: None (yet)
- **Team**: One human (so far) + one AI
- **Legal Entity**: Not formed (yet)
- **Infrastructure**: Patreon, Discord, GitHub
- **Version**: Alpha
- **Phase**: Vision crystallization & core structure
- **Open Beta**: Coming soon

This project is being prototyped publicly, transparently, and with a deep desire for collaboration. It’s a personal vision that’s being translated into something open-source and replicable—so that anyone, anywhere, can co-own it and make it real.
You are welcome to:

- 🧪 Test the framework  
- ✍️ Help improve documents  
- 🎨 Design tools or visuals  
- 🏗️ Start a prototype Node  
- 💬 Ask hard questions

## Why Transparency Matters

SOUL is built on the belief that **power should be accountable**, and **trust must be earned** through openness—not image.

We don’t believe in gatekeeping ideas, exaggerating progress, or creating artificial mystique.

This isn’t a brand.
This isn’t a pitch.
This is a public prototype.

Transparency is how we protect our values *before* there's money, status, or power at stake. We begin how we mean to continue.

## What Transparency Looks Like for SOUL

Here are the **specific ways** we practice and aspire to transparency:

### Financial Transparency

- All income and spending will be tracked in a **public ledger**
- Major purchases include **photos, receipts, or explanations**
- Monthly **financial reports** will be shared via Discord and Patreon
- Compensation (if and when it begins) will be **capped and disclosed**

We currently follow a **33 / 33 / 33 model** for future budgeting:

- 33% for **direct humanitarian aid**
- 33% for **savings/reserves**
- 33% for **infrastructure and operations**

Right now? We haven’t spent or received a dollar.

---

###  Structural Transparency

- No paywalls for core content—**everything is shared freely**
- No private strategy groups—**all major docs are open for feedback**
- The Discord server will have **public meeting logs** and discussion history
- Node and Nexus designs include **rotating leadership and open notes**
- All decisions about the project structure are published and discussable

There are no hidden leaders. No steering committee. Just one person trying to do this the right way—with full visibility.

---

### Ideological Transparency

- We are **not a political party, religion, or protest movement**
- There is **no central belief required** to participate
- Our philosophy is written plainly and openly [link to philosophy](https://societyofunifiedlife.github.io/SOUL-Website/about/philosophy.html)
- We encourage thoughtful debate, revision, and public dialogue
- We invite scrutiny—not to "win" arguments, but to improve alignment

---

### Operational Transparency

- All SOUL documents will be **versioned**, timestamped, and open to review
- GitHub (or equivalent) will house a growing library of source files
- Discord and Patreon are **real-time mirrors** of project development
- Any future app/tool will be **open-source and documented for audit**

In the future, contributors will have clear options for anonymous vs. public collaboration, with peer review systems and clear records of what’s being built and why.

---

## The Road Ahead

We hope to soon:

- **Launch our first test Nodes** through park cleanups and service gatherings
- **Incorporate as a nonprofit** (once it’s safe and necessary)
- **Onboard contributors** to help refine tools and build shared systems
- **Run our first open feedback cycles** with playtesters and aligned volunteers

None of this happens without trust, and **trust begins today**—not after the grant, the logo, or the follower count.

---

## Final Note: The Culture We’re Creating

We don’t sell influence.  
We don’t buy loyalty.  
We don’t pretend to be further along than we are.

If we are to demonstrate a better way of building trust, leadership, and systems—**we must live that better way from the start.**

Thank you for holding us to it.

**We stand together.**
