## Why Transparency Matters

The Society of Unified Life (SOUL) is built on a single, quiet truth: that trust is earned through clarity, not persuasion.

We are not a business.  
We are not a church.  
We are not a political party.

We are a **decentralized humanitarian framework**—an open-source experiment in cooperative, nonviolent, and transparent living. And if we are to stand for anything at all, it must begin with openness.

This document is our first step toward radical clarity. It’s not perfect—but it’s honest. And it will evolve.

## What Transparency Means to Us

Our transparency is guided by four key principles:

1. **Open by Default**  
   Information is public unless there’s a strong ethical reason to protect it (e.g., personal privacy or safety).

2. **Receipts or It Didn’t Happen**  
   Every expense is documented. Every major decision is logged. Every role is explained.

3. **Decentralized Accountability**  
   No single person holds unchecked power. Peers, supporters, and local circles hold each other to account.

4. **Clarity Over Spin**  
   No marketing fluff. Just real data, context, and honest answers.

## Our Current Operating Reality (as of July 2025)

We’re still in **Phase 1: Seeding the Vision**. That means:

- **Founder-run**: Most of the labor is currently being done by one person (Aaron), who is developing documents, coordinating Discord and web infrastructure, and managing outreach.

- **Public-facing assets live**:
  - [Website](https://societyofunifiedlife.org)
  - [Discord server](https://discord.gg/q7fjhCwk)
  - [Patreon](https://patreon.com/SocietyofUnifiedLife)
  - [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@SocietyofUnifiedLife)

- **No paid staff** yet, but seeking minimum income for full-time focus via Patreon.

- **Transparency documents live**:
  - Strategic outline, financial plan, role frameworks, and operational models are publicly available.

- **Ledger is launching soon**: We will maintain a public Google Sheet or Notion ledger detailing all income and expenses, down to the penny.

## How We Handle Money

### Financial Model

We follow a **33 / 33 / 33 model** for incoming support:

- **33% Humanitarian**: Supplies for real-world action (cleanup gear, food, outreach kits).
- **33% Reserves**: Legal fees, emergency buffer, nonprofit filing, growth support.
- **33% Operations**: Tech tools, digital outreach, content creation, basic compensation.

### Compensation & Limits

- **Founder compensation is capped** at a modest living wage.
- No bonuses, perks, or luxury spending.
- No compensation ever based on donation amount or status.
- All funds are used for tools, logistics, and impact—not for personal enrichment.

### Documentation Tools

We’re currently transitioning into using:

- **Google Sheets / Notion** for our initial public ledger
- **Monthly transparency reports** shared via Discord and Patreon
- **Receipts and photos** linked for larger expenses
- **OpenCollective** and other audit-friendly platforms (in progress)

## Trust Starts Now

Even while we are small, we act as if the world is watching—because one day it will be.

We are not asking for blind faith. We are inviting **shared vigilance**.

We welcome your ideas.  
We welcome your feedback.  
We welcome your accountability.

## Final Note: A Culture of Clarity

Transparency isn’t a PR strategy—it’s how we **prevent corruption**, **dispel confusion**, and **build a new culture**.

You don’t need to agree with us to hold us accountable.  
You don’t need to donate to ask hard questions.

We welcome scrutiny—not because we want control, but because we’re building something that should never need it.

This is the beginning of our relationship with you.

Thank you for holding us to the standard we hope to represent.

**We stand together.**
